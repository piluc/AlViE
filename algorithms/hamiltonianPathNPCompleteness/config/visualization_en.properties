unvisitedNodeColor=000000
ieLastRhombusCompleted=The rhombus of the last variable has been completed by connecting it to a sink node t.
selectSecondInputMessage=Select the satisfying truth assignment
visitedNodeColor=FFFFFF
algorithmCategory=NP-completeness
ieVariableClauseConnected=The nodes in green corresponding to the literals appearing in the clause corresponding to node in gray have been connected to this latter node by the edges in red. Moreover, the clause node has been connected to the nodes in azure corresponding to the opposite literals by the edges in green.
clauseNodeColor=AAAAAA
ieGraphCreated=The graph corresponding to the Boolean formula has been created.
literalNodeColor=00FF00
diamondNodeInterspace=100
literalClauseEdgeColor=FF0000
selectFirstInputMessage=Select the Boolean formula
algorithmName=Hamiltonian path
ieDetourStarted=Since the azure node corresponding to a clause that has not been visited yet, the path passes through it now.
ieSatAssignmentDefined=A satisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to derive a Hamiltonian path.
clauseLiteralEdgeColor=00FF00
diamondHeight=120
ieNextTriangleCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the next variable have been created. These nodes and edges form the upper part of the rhombus corresponding to this variable\: the diagonal of this rhombus contains as many nodes as twice the number of clauses.
algorithmFileName=HamiltonianPathNPCompleteness
formulaTitle=Formula
algorithmDescription=A polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to Hamiltonian Path
ieVariableTrue=Since the current variable is true, the path continues on the left.
ieClauseNodesAdded=The nodes corresponding to the clauses have been added.
ieUnsatAssignmentDefined=An unsatisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to try to derive a Hamiltonian path.
algorithmVisualizationFileName=HamiltonianPathNPCompleteness
ieNotHamiltonianPath=At least one clause node has not been visited by the path, which is due to the fact that the assignment does not satisfy the formula.
graphName=Graph
ieVariableNodeVisited=The path enters the rhombus corresponding to the azure variable.
ieDetourEnded=From the node corresponding to the just visited clause, the path returns within the current diagonal.
ieHamiltonianPath=All clause nodes have been visited by the path, which is due to the fact that the assignment satisfies the formula.
ieStart=Boolean formula in CNF that has to be reduced to a Hamiltonian path instance.
graphShape=Rectangular
formulaXMLDrawerOriginY=20
oppositeLiteralNodeColor=00FFFF
formulaXMLDrawerOriginX=20
ieLastEdge=The path ends by visiting the sink node t, from which there are no outgoing edges.
nodeWidth=50
ieFirstTriangleCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the first variable have been created. These nodes and edges form the upper part of the rhombus corresponding to this variable\: the diagonal of this rhombus contains as many nodes as twice the number of clauses.
ieDiagonalNodeVisited=The azure node of the current rhombus diagonal has just been visited.
justReachedNodeColor=00FFFF
graphXMLDrawerOriginY=80
graphXMLDrawerOriginX=20
unvisitedArcColor=000000
selectThirdInputMessage=Select the unsatisfying truth assignment
ieTrianglesConnected=The rhombus of the previous variable has been completed by connecting it to the rhombus of the current variable by means of two edges.
visitedArcColor=FF0000
ieVariableFalse=Since the current variable is false, the path continues on the right.
