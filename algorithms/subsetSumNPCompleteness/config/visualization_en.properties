notReachedSumElementColor=FFFF00
selectSecondInputMessage=Select the satisfying truth assignment
algorithmCategory=NP-completeness
ieFirstVariableDigit=The first digits of the two numbers corresponding to the current variable have been set all to 0 but the one digit corresponding to the variable index (which has been set to 1).
filledElementColor=FFFFFF
ieEmptyNumbers=The set will contain 2 numbers p and n for each variable and two numbers x and y for each clause\: the last row of the matrix will show the required sum s.
elementHeight=22
reachedSumElementColor=00FF00
ieClauseWithTwo=Since the current clause is satisfied by two literals, the subset includes only the first of the two numbers corresponding to the clause.
ieSecondVariableDigit=The successive digits of the two numbers corresponding to the current variable have been set all to 0 but the ones corresponding to the occurrences of the variable or of its negation within a clause (which have been set to 1).
selectFirstInputMessage=Select the Boolean formula
algorithmName=Subset Sum
ieSatAssignmentDefined=A satisfying truth assignment will now be used to determine a subset whose sum is the required one.
ieMatrixCreated=The set of all numbers have been created\: the required sum is the last row of the matrix.
ieSubsetComputed=A subset whose sum is equal to the required value has been found\: this is due to the fact that the assignment satisfies the formula.
algorithmFileName=SubsetSumNPCompleteness
formulaTitle=Formula
ieSecondSumDigit=The successive digits of the sum have been all set to 3, so that, for each clause, at least one number corresponding to a literal occurring in the clause must be taken.
algorithmDescription=A polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to Subset Sum
ieVariableTrue=Since the current variable is true, the subset includes the first of the two numbers corresponding to the variable.
ieUnsatAssignmentDefined=An unsatisfying truth assignment will now be used to try to determine a subset whose sum is the required one.
algorithmVisualizationFileName=SubsetSumNPCompleteness
ieClauseWithThree=Since the current clause is satisfied by three literals, the subset does not include any of the two numbers corresponding to the clause.
justFilledElementColor=00FFFF
ieStart=Boolean formula in CNF that has to be reduced to a set of integer numbers and a required sum.
ieClauseDigit=The digits of the two numbers corresponding to the current clause have been set all to 0 but the one digit corresponding to the clause index (which has been set to 1).

formulaXMLDrawerOriginX=20
matrixXMLDrawerOriginY=80
matrixXMLDrawerOriginX=20
ieFirstSumDigit=The first digits of the sum have been all set to 1, so that, for each variable, exactly one number must be taken.
ieNoSubset=Since the current clause is not satisfied, the digit corresponding to the clause cannot be obtained.
elementWidth=50
ieClauseWithOne=Since the current clause is satisfied by one literal, the subset includes both numbers corresponding to the clause.
matrixName=Matrix
selectThirdInputMessage=Select the unsatisfying truth assignment
unusedNumberColor=000000
firstRowElementColor=BBBBBB
ieVariableFalse=Since the current variable is false, the subset includes the second of the two numbers corresponding to the variable.
