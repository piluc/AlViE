algorithmCategory=Miscellanea
ieNewCounterElementBegin=The blue node can now be inserted in the rightmost free position of the topological sort array.
ieNewCounterElementEnd=The blue node has been inserted in the topological sort array.
graphFont=Courier-PLAIN-16
pseudocodeEmphasizedLineColor=AAAAAA
ieRecursiveDepthFirstSearchOrderEnd=The recursive depth first visit started from the blue node has terminated.
pseudocodeOriginY=20
pseudocodeOriginX=380
graphNodeShape=Elliptical
pseudocodeLineHeight=20
ieNextIteration=The blue node is examined in order to determine whether it has not been reached and, if this is the case, to start the depth first visit from it.
algorithmName=Topological sort 
etaFont=Courier-PLAIN-16
etaXMLDrawerOriginY=300
algorithmFileName=TopologicalSort
etaXMLDrawerOriginX=20
algorithmDescription=A depth-first search based algorithm for computing a topological ordering of a DAG
ieNewNodeReached=The blue node is marked as reached and drawn as a rectangle.
ieRecursiveDepthFirstSearchOrderStart=The depth first visit starts from the blue node.
algorithmVisualizationFileName=TopologicalSort
sourceNodeColor=00FFFF
graphName=DAG
pseudocodeTitle=Pseudo-code
etaColor=FFFFFF
nextNodeColor=00FFFF
ieStart=Directed acyclic graph of which we want to compute the topological sort (shown in the bottom)\: as soon as a node is reached, it will be drawn as a rectangle.

graphShape=Elliptical
pseudocodeFileName=TopologicalSortPseudocode
pseudocodeEmphasizedLineHeight=20

selectInputMessage=Select the directed acyclic graph
ieEnd=The topological sort has been computed.

ieNeighborRecursiveDepthFirstSearchOrderEnd=The recursive depth first visit started from the yellow node (neighbor of the blue node) has terminated.
ieNeighborRecursiveDepthFirstSearchOrderStart=The yellow node (neighbor of the blue node) has not bee reached yet, and, hence, the depth first visit starts from it.
targetNodeColor=FFFF00
pseudocodeVisible=true
