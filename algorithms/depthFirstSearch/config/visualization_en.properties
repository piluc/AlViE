ieEnd=Final state of the graph after all the nodes have been visited.
ieInitialNodePushed=The starting node (in green) has been inserted in the stack.
ieListAdiacencyExplorationEnded=The adjacency list analysis of the red node is finished.
ieNewNodeReached=The red node is marked as true (that is gray) in the array of reached nodes.
ieNextNodeHasBeenPopped=The red node has been extracted from the stack: the red arcs denote the path which has been followed to go from the initial node to the red one.
ieNextNodeToBePopped=The red node has to be extracted from the stack to analyze its adjacency list.
ieNodeHasBeenAlreadyReached=The red node has already been reached: hence, its adjacency list has not to be analyzed.
ieNodeHasBeenPushed=The node linked to the red one by the blue edge has been inserted in the stack.
ieNodeHasBeenReached=The red node has been marked as true (that is gray) in the array of reached nodes.
ieNodeToBePushed=The node linked to the red one by the blue edge has to be inserted in the stack.
ieReachedInitialized=The array of reached nodes has been initialized setting all its elements to false (that is white).
ieStart=Initial connected graph to visit.
