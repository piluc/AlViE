gridTitle=Grid
algorithmCategory=Dynamic programming
ieNewFirstColumnElementComputed=The length of the longest path corresponding to the element in azure has been computed\: its value is equal to the longest path corresponding to the element in green plus the weight of the edge connecting the two elements.
gridEdgeColor=AAAAAA
pseudocodeEmphasizedLineColor=CCCCCC
pseudocodeOriginY=320

pseudocodeLineHeight=20
algorithmName=Longest path
ieFirstLongestPathComputed=The length of the longest path corresponding to the source node has been initialized.
algorithmFileName=LongestPath
previousElementColor=00FF00
ieNewFirstRowElementComputed=The length of the longest path corresponding to the element in azure has been computed\: its value is equal to the longest path corresponding to the element in green plus the weight of the edge connecting the two elements.
algorithmDescription=A dynamic programming based algorithm for solving the longest path problem on grids
newElementColor=00FFFF
newLongestPathColor=FFFF00
algorithmVisualizationFileName=LongestPath
pseudocodeTitle=Pseudo-code
ieStart=We solve the longest path problem on grid by using the dynamic programming paradigm\: the white cells are the nodes while the gray cells are the weighted edges.

pseudocodeEmphasizedLineHeight=20
ieNewLongestPathComputationStarted=The computation of the length of a new longest path started: in order to compute the length of the longest path corresponding to the node in azure, we make use of the lengths of the longest paths corresponding to the green nodes.
ieNewLongestPathComputationEnded=The length of the longest path corresponding to the node in azure has been set equal to the maximum between the sums of the lengths of the longest paths corresponding to the green nodes plus the edge connecting them to the azure node.
pseudocodeLineWidth=600
selectInputMessage=Select the grid
ieEnd=The length of the longest path has been computed and is shown in yellow.
