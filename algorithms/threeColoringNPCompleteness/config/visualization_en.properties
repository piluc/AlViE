selectSecondInputMessage=Select the satisfying truth assignment
nodePairDistance=50
algorithmCategory=NP-completeness
ieClauseNodesColoringStarted=The nodes corresponding to the clauses will now be colored by using the coloring rules depicted in the matrix.
clauseNodeLabelColor=00FFFF
ieClauseNodesColored=The nodes and edges corresponding to the current clause have been colored by using the rule specified by the row whose first three columns are equal to the color of the three literals contained in the clause.
ieFixedNodesCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the true, false, and null variable assignment have been created.
ieNotColoring=At least one node among the a, b, and d nodes of the current clause cannot be colored since the false color cannot be used\: this is due to the fact that the assignment does not satisfy this clause.
ieGraphCreated=The graph corresponding to the Boolean formula has been created.
ieVariableNodesCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the next variable have been created.
selectFirstInputMessage=Select the Boolean formula
algorithmName=3-Coloring
justCreatedNodeColor=00FF00
nullNodeColor=CCCCCC
ieSatAssignmentDefined=A satisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to derive a 3-coloring of the graph.
falseNodeColor=FF00FF
algorithmFileName=ThreeColoringNPCompleteness
trueNodeColor=00FF00
ieColoring=All nodes have been colored, which is due to the fact that the assignment satisfies the formula.
formulaTitle=Formula
algorithmDescription=A polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to 3-Coloring
uncoloredNodeColor=FFFFFF
coloringRuleTitle=Coloring rule
ieUnsatAssignmentDefined=An unsatisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to try to derive a 3-coloring of the graph.
algorithmVisualizationFileName=ThreeColoringNPCompleteness
graphName=Graph
ieClauseNodesCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the current clause have been added.
ieFalseVariableNodesColored=Since the current variable is false, the color assigned to its two nodes p and n are equal to the false and true color, respectively.
ieFixedNodesColored=The color of the nodes corresponding to the true, false, and null variable assignment has been decided.
ieStart=Boolean formula in CNF that has to be reduced to a 3-coloring instance graph.
