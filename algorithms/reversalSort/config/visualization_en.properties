ieBreakpointExists=There are still breakpoints (the first one is shown in azure)\: another iteration of the WHILE has to be performed.
ieDecreasingStripFound=A decreasing strip has been found.
ieDownComputed=The down array has been computed\: down[i] gives the position of the left end of the leftmost decreasing strip beginning at or to the right of position i.
ieEnd=The array has been sorted.
ieIncreasingStripFound=An increasing strip has been found\: this strip has now to be reversed.
ieInversePermutationComputed=The inverse permutation of the current permutation has been computed.
ieNewMinimumDecreasingStripFound=The strip in yellow is decreasing and contains the currently minimum number.
ieNextArrayGenerated=The reversal has been applied and a new array has been generated.
ieNoDecreasingStrips=There is no decreasing strip in the current sequence\: hence, an increasing strip has to be found.
ieOneReversalFound=A reversal that removes one breakpoint has been found and is shown in yellow.
ieOneReversalWithDecreasingStripFound=A reversal that removes one breakpoint and leaves a decreasing strip has been found and is shown in yellow.
ieOneReversalWithDecreasingStripBreakpointFoundCaseA=Two breakpoints corresponding to a reversal that removes one of them have been found\: this case corresponds to Figure 6(a).
ieOneReversalWithDecreasingStripBreakpointFoundCaseB=Two breakpoints corresponding to a reversal that removes one of them have been found\: this case corresponds to Figure 6(b).
ieReversalComputed=The interval to be reversed has been identified.
ieStart=Initial array that we want to sort by using reversal operations\: this array corresponds to the 36 genes that are common to the linearized mitochondrial genomes of mammals and the flaworm Ascaris suum.
ieTwoReversalBreakpointsFound=Two breakpoints corresponding to a reversal that removes both of them have been found\: the computation made use of the azure element of the inverse permutation.
ieTwoReversalFound=A reversal that removes two breakpoints has been found and is shown in yellow.
ieUpComputed=The up array has been computed\: up[i] gives the position of the left end of the leftmost increasing strip beginning at or to the right of the position i.
ieZeroReversalFound=A reversal that does not increase the number of breakpoints has been found and is shown in yellow.
