ieNewNodeAnalysisEnd=The analysis of the neighborhood of the azure node ended\: the yellow nodes (if any) and the grey one (if it does not coincide with the azure one) have been already examined.
examinedNodeColor=FFFF00
ieSetNewDistance=The distance of the green node has been decreased by setting it equal to the distance of its azure predecessor plus the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
