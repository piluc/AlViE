arrayFont=Courier-PLAIN-16
ieHalvingRequired=The deletion operation reduced the number of elements to one fourth of the array dimension, it is then necessary to halve the array dimension.

selectInputMessage=Select the operation sequence
ieInsertOperation1=The insertion of 
ieInsertOperation2=has to be executed.
ieHalvingNotRequired=The deletion operation did not reduce the number of elements to one fourth of the array dimension, then it is not necessary to halve the array dimension.
pseudocodeFont=Courier-PLAIN-16
ieEnd=Final state of the array after the execution of all insertion and deletion operations.

arrayName=Array
ieDoublingRequired=To execute the insertion operation the array dimension has to be doubled, since the size of the array is equal to the number of its elements.

ieDeleteEnded=The deletion operation has been executed.
ieStart=Initial state of the array\: all the elements are empty.

algorithmFileName=DynamicArray
ieDoublingNotRequired=To execute the insertion operation the array dimension has not to be doubled, since the size of the array is greater than the number of its elements.
