ieAfterFirstRecursiveCall=The DFT of the even-index numbers inside the gray node has been calculated and it is included in the green node.
ieAfterSecondRecursiveCall=The DFT of the odd-index numbers inside the gray node has been calculated and it is included in the green node.
ieBeforeFirstInvocation=We calculate the discrete Fourier transform of the real numbers inside the node.
ieBeforeFirstRecursiveCall=To calculate the DFT of the numbers inside the gray node, we have to calculate the DFT of the even-index numbers, which are included in the green node.
ieBeforeReturn=The DFT of the gray node has been calculated.
ieBeforeSecondRecursiveCall=To calculate the DFT of the numbers inside the gray node, we have to calculate the DFT of the odd-index numbers, which are included in the green node.
ieEnd=The DFT of the vector of real numbers has been calculated and is the following vector: 
ieSingleNumber=The DFT of a single number is the number itself
ieStart=A vector of real numbers whose discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has to be computed by means of the divide et impera paradigm.
