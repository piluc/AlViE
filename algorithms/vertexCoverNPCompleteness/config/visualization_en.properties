ieCovered=All edges have been covered with one node per variable and two nodes per clause\: this is due to the fact that the assignment satisfies the formula.
selectSecondInputMessage=Select the satisfying truth assignment
nodePairDistance=100
algorithmCategory=NP-completeness
ieClauseNodesTaken=Two nodes of the triangle corresponding to the current clause have been included in the cover\: in this way all edges adjacent to the triangle are now covered.
ieGraphCreated=The graph corresponding to the Boolean formula has been created.
ieVariableNodesCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the next variable have been created.
selectFirstInputMessage=Select the Boolean formula
algorithmName=Vertex Cover
justCreatedNodeColor=00FF00
ieSatAssignmentDefined=A satisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to derive a vertex cover of the graph.
algorithmFileName=VertexCoverNPCompleteness
formulaTitle=Boolean formula
algorithmDescription=A polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to Vertex Cover
ieFalseVariableNodeTaken=Since the current variable is false, its node n is included in the vertex cover.
untakenNodeColor=FFFFFF
ieTrueVariableNodeTaken=Since the current variable is true, its node p is included in the vertex cover.
ieUnsatAssignmentDefined=An unsatisfying assignment to the variables will now be used to try to derive a vertex cover of the graph.
algorithmVisualizationFileName=VertexCoverNPCompleteness
graphName=Graph
ieClauseNodesCreated=The nodes and edges corresponding to the current clause have been added.
justTakenNodeColor=00FFFF
variableClauseGadgetDistance=200
ieStart=Boolean formula in CNF that has to be reduced to a Vertex Cover instance graph.
graphShape=Rectangular
ieNotCovered=All the nodes of the triangle of the current clause have to be included in the cover\: this is due to the fact that the assignment does not satisfy this clause.
