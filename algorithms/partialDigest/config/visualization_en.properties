ieCursorPositioned=The two cursors scanning the sub-array have been positioned at the leftmost (green) and at the rightmost (gray) positions.
algorithmCategory=Exhaustive Search
ieRightCursorBacked=The gray cursor retreated of one position since its pointed element was greater than the pivot.
iePivotHasToBeMovedAtEnd=The pivot (yellow) and the last element of the array (green) have to be swapped. 
pseudocodeEmphasizedLineColor=FFFF00
pseudocodeOriginY=120
ieAfterSwap=The elements pointed by the two cursors have been swapped.
pseudocodeOriginX=20
ieAfterDistribution=The yellow sub-array has been modified by distributing its elements on the left and on the right of the pivot.
recursiveCallBinaryTreeTitle=Recursive call tree
pseudocodeLineHeight=15
algorithmName=PartialDigest
ieLastSwapDone=The pivot (yellow) and the green element have been swapped.
ieBeforeRightRecursiveInvocation=The algorithm continues on the green right part of the yellow sub-array.
ieBeforeSwap=The elements pointed by the two cursors have to be swapped.
sonColor=00FF00
algorithmFileName=PartialDigest
algorithmDescription=A practical (even though exponential) algorithm for the partial digest problem

recursiveCallBinaryTreeXMLDrawerOriginX=500
algorithmVisualizationFileName=PartialDigest
pseudocodeTitle=PartialDigest
ieBeforeDistribution=The pivot has been chosen and the yellow sub-array has to be modified by distributing its elements on the left and on the right of the pivot itself.
ieStart=Initial array that have to be sorted by means of the Quicksort algorithm.
pseudocodeEmphasizedLineWidth=450
fatherColor=FFFF00
pseudocodeFont=Courier-PLAIN-16

pseudocodeEmphasizedLineHeight=15
ieFirstRecursiveInvocation=The algorithm starts by invoking the recursive function for the first time with arguments the array extremes.
nodeWidth=200
nodeHeight=40
pseudocodeLineWidth=450
selectInputMessage=Select the multi-set
iePivotMovedAtEnd=The pivot (yellow) and the last element of the sub-array (green) have been swapped.
ieEnd=The array has been sorted.
ieDistributionStart=The sub-array elements that are smaller than the pivot (yellow) have to go on its left, while the greater ones have to go on its right.
ieBeforeLeftRecursiveInvocation=The algorithm continues on the green left part of the yellow sub-array.
ieAfterLeftRecursiveInvocation=The part of the yellow sub-array on the left of the pivot is now sorted.
ieDistributionEnd=The distribution ended and the sub-array elements that are smaller than the pivot (yellow) are on its left, while the greater ones are on its right.
ieLastSwapNeeded=The pivot (yellow) and the green element have to be swapped.
ieLeftCursorAdvanced=The green cursor advanced of one position since its pointed element was smaller than the pivot.
ieAfterRightRecursiveInvocation=The yellow sub-array is now sorted.
