# AlViE
This is the Java code of the Algorithm Visualization Environment (in short, AlViE) which has been used in the the following papers.

- P. Crescenzi, C. Nocentini. Fully integrating algorithm visualization into a CS2 course: a two-year experience. Proc. ITiCSE, 296-300, 2007.
- P. Crescenzi. Using AVs to explain NP-completeness. Proc. ITiCSE, 299, 2010.
- P. Crescenzi, E, Enstr√∂m, V. Kann. From theory to practice: NP-completeness for every CS student. Proc. ITiCSE, 16-21, 2013.

This code is not maintained anymore, but it should still work as expected (by using the Java libraries included in the lib folder) when run with JDK 16.

## Executing AlViE
Once imported the repository (either, for example, in Eclipse or in VS Code), executing the class `org.algoritmica.alvie.desktop.Main` will start AlViE (note that the first time AlViE is run, the file `.alvie4settings` is created inside the user's home folder). Once AlViE has been started, an empty window appears with the toolbar shown in the following figure.
