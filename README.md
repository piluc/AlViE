# AlViE
This is the Java code of the Algorithm Visualization Environment (in short, AlViE) which has been used in the the following papers.

- P. Crescenzi, C. Nocentini. Fully integrating algorithm visualization into a CS2 course: a two-year experience. Proc. ITiCSE, 296-300, 2007.
- P. Crescenzi. Using AVs to explain NP-completeness. Proc. ITiCSE, 299, 2010.
- P. Crescenzi, E, Enstr√∂m, V. Kann. From theory to practice: NP-completeness for every CS student. Proc. ITiCSE, 16-21, 2013.

This code is not maintained anymore, but it should still work as expected (by using the Java libraries included in the lib folder).
